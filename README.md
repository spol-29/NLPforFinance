Harnessing machine learning(NLP) in order to process financial data for sentiment analysis.

This project uses natural language processing, more specifically sentiment analysis in order to determine the emotions that are displayed within financial data.
Sentiment analysis is a great tool that is used for determining a person's sentiment or emotion which is a vital factor when it comes to stocks which is fast changing.
Using sentiment analysis is a great tool that can be used in the field of finance because it is fast and efficient as well as accurate.

I implemented multiple ways to do sentiment analysis which includes utilizing the BERT model(pretrained) in order to perform this.

There are a few datasets that were used.
